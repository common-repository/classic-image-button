== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = Why disable inline styles? =
 Sometimes feed readers will strip away the style="" tag from your blog posts causing your images to look funny in RSS feeds. By disabling the inline styles, your border, align, vspace and hspace image attributes will be added as separate image attributes, which are more likely to be recongized by most feed readers.
